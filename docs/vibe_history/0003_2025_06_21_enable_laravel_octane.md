# Task: Enable Laravel Octane for High-Performance Application Serving

**Date**: 2025-06-21  
**Completed by**: GitHub Copilot

## What Was Requested
- Enable Laravel Octane in the Laravel project
- Set up high-performance application server using FrankenPHP
- Provide documentation and easy-to-use commands for development and production use
- Ensure the setup follows Laravel best practices and maintains code quality standards

## What Was Done
- **Installed Laravel Octane**: Added `laravel/octane v2.10.0` package via Composer
- **Configured FrankenPHP Server**: Set up FrankenPHP as the default server (modern, Go-based server with HTTP/2 support)
- **Downloaded FrankenPHP Binary**: Automatically downloaded the macOS-compatible FrankenPHP binary (~133MB)
- **Added File Watching**: Installed chokidar for development file watching capabilities
- **Environment Configuration**: Added Octane environment variables to `.env` and `.env.example`
- **Enhanced Makefile**: Added comprehensive Octane commands for easy server management
- **Created Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and usage documentation in `docs/OCTANE_SETUP.md`

## Files Modified
1. **composer.json**: Added laravel/octane dependency
2. **package.json**: Added chokidar dev dependency for file watching
3. **config/octane.php**: Generated and configured with FrankenPHP as default server
4. **.env**: Added `OCTANE_SERVER=frankenphp` and `OCTANE_HTTPS=false`
5. **.env.example**: Created with all environment variables including Octane config
6. **Makefile**: Added octane-start, octane-dev, octane-stop, octane-reload, octane-status commands
7. **docs/OCTANE_SETUP.md**: Comprehensive documentation for setup and usage

## Technical Details
- **Server Choice**: FrankenPHP selected for its modern architecture, HTTP/2/3 support, and built-in compression
- **Default Configuration**: Server boots on port 8000 with automatic worker management
- **Development Mode**: File watching enabled for automatic server reloading during development
- **Memory Management**: Configured with proper request limits and worker recycling
- **Makefile Integration**: `make serve` now uses Octane instead of standard PHP dev server

## New Commands Available
```bash
# Development with file watching
make octane-dev
make serve  # Alias for octane-dev

# Production
make octane-start

# Management
make octane-stop
make octane-reload
make octane-status
```

## Performance Benefits
- **Significant Performance Gain**: Application boots once and stays in memory
- **Faster Response Times**: No Laravel bootstrap overhead per request
- **Modern Web Features**: HTTP/2, compression, early hints support
- **Memory Efficiency**: Persistent application state with proper garbage collection

## Verification
- ✅ **Pint**: Zero styling issues
- ✅ **PHPStan**: Zero static analysis errors
- ✅ **Tests**: All tests passing (2/2)
- ✅ **Octane Server**: Successfully started and stopped on test port 8001
- ✅ **File Watching**: Chokidar installed and ready for development

## Configuration Highlights
- **Default Server**: FrankenPHP (configured in config/octane.php)
- **Development Port**: 8000 (configurable)
- **File Watching**: Enabled for app/, config/, routes/, resources/ directories
- **Environment Variables**: OCTANE_SERVER and OCTANE_HTTPS properly configured

## Notes for Future
- **Memory Monitoring**: Monitor application memory usage in production
- **Worker Management**: Adjust worker count based on server capacity
- **SSL Configuration**: Set OCTANE_HTTPS=true when using HTTPS in production
- **Reverse Proxy**: Consider Nginx for static assets and SSL termination in production
- **Process Management**: Use Supervisor or similar for production process management
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark application performance improvements

## Follow-up Tasks
- Consider setting up production deployment scripts
- Monitor memory usage patterns during development
- Document performance benchmarks once application is more complete
- Set up production monitoring and alerting for Octane processes
