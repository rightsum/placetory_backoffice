# Task: Google Cloud Run Deployment Setup with Database and Redis
**Date**: 2025-06-21
**Completed by**: GitHub Copilot

## What Was Requested
- Set up deployment configuration for Google Cloud Run
- Connect the application to Cloud SQL (MySQL) database
- Connect the application to Memory Store (Redis)
- Put all deployment files in a "deploy" folder
- Ensure high-performance deployment using FrankenPHP/Octane

## What Was Done
- Created comprehensive deployment configuration in `/deploy` folder
- Set up Docker containerization with FrankenPHP for high performance
- Created automated deployment script with full Google Cloud infrastructure setup
- Configured VPC networking for secure private communication
- Set up Cloud SQL (MySQL) and Memory Store (Redis) instances
- Added health check endpoint to Laravel application
- Updated Makefile with deployment commands
- Created comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guide

## Technical Details

### Files Created:
1. **`deploy/Dockerfile`**: Multi-stage Docker build with FrankenPHP, Node.js, and optimized Laravel setup
2. **`deploy/deploy.sh`**: Automated deployment script that creates all required Google Cloud infrastructure
3. **`deploy/migrate.sh`**: Database migration script using Cloud Run Jobs
4. **`deploy/cloud-run.yaml`**: Declarative Cloud Run service configuration
5. **`deploy/cloudbuild.yaml`**: Cloud Build configuration for CI/CD pipeline
6. **`deploy/.env.production`**: Environment variables template for production
7. **`deploy/frankenphp/Caddyfile`**: FrankenPHP/Caddy server configuration
8. **`deploy/.dockerignore`**: Docker build optimization
9. **`deploy/README.md`**: Comprehensive deployment guide

### Infrastructure Setup:
- **VPC Network**: Private network for secure communication between services
- **VPC Connector**: Allows Cloud Run to communicate with VPC resources
- **Cloud SQL**: MySQL 8.0 instance with private IP, automated backups
- **Memory Store**: Redis 7.0 instance for caching and sessions
- **Cloud Run**: Serverless container platform with autoscaling (0-10 instances)
- **Container Registry**: For storing Docker images

### Performance Optimizations:
- **FrankenPHP**: High-performance PHP server with worker mode
- **Multi-stage Docker build**: Optimized image size and build time
- **Redis caching**: Used for cache, sessions, and queue storage
- **Octane integration**: Laravel Octane with FrankenPHP for maximum performance
- **Resource allocation**: 1 vCPU, 512MB RAM with auto-scaling

### Security Features:
- Private IP addresses for database and Redis
- VPC isolation for all services
- No public database access
- Secure environment variable management
- Health check endpoints for monitoring

### Laravel Integration:
- Added `/health` endpoint for Cloud Run health checks
- Updated Makefile with deployment commands:
  - `make deploy`: Full deployment
  - `make deploy-migrate`: Run migrations
  - `make deploy-build`: Build Docker image
- Environment configuration for production use

## Verification
- All deployment files created and properly configured
- Scripts made executable with proper permissions
- Health check endpoint added to Laravel routes
- Makefile updated with deployment commands
- Comprehensive documentation provided

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Deployment:
```bash
# Set your Google Cloud project
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION="us-central1"

# Deploy everything
make deploy

# Run migrations after deployment
make deploy-migrate
```

### Manual Steps:
1. Install Google Cloud SDK and authenticate
2. Set project ID in deployment script
3. Run `./deploy/deploy.sh`
4. Run `./deploy/migrate.sh` for database setup
5. Configure domain and SSL if needed

## Notes for Future
- **Cost Management**: Uses minimal tiers (db-f1-micro, 1GB Redis) for cost efficiency
- **Scaling**: Configured to scale from 0 to 10 instances based on traffic
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and logging configured for observability
- **Updates**: Use the same deployment script for updates
- **CI/CD**: Cloud Build configuration ready for automated deployments

### Environment Variables to Configure:
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: Your Google Cloud project ID
- `APP_KEY`: Laravel application key (generated during deployment)
- Database and Redis credentials (generated automatically)
- Custom domain settings if not using default Cloud Run URLs

### Follow-up Tasks:
1. Configure custom domain and SSL certificate
2. Set up monitoring and alerting
3. Configure backup schedules
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline with Cloud Build triggers
5. Review and adjust resource allocation based on usage patterns

This deployment provides a production-ready, scalable, and secure Laravel application on Google Cloud with optimized performance using FrankenPHP and comprehensive infrastructure automation.
